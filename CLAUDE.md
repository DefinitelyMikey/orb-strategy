Instruments: MNQ, NQ, ES, MES, MGC.

---

## 1. ORB Definition

- **Timeframe**: 15-min chart only (hardcoded)
- **ORB candle**: 8:00 AM ET candle (single 15-min candle, 8:00–8:15 AM)
- **ORB high**: wick high of 8:00 AM candle
- **ORB low**: wick low of 8:00 AM candle
- **ORB midpoint**: (ORB high + ORB low) / 2
- **ORB resets**: daily

---

## 2. Setup Conditions

### Setup Quality

| Grade | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| **A+** | Price breaks ORB level → retraces to ORB midpoint → B.O.S. triggers |
| **Valid** | Price touches ORB range OR revisits a previous swing high/low before B.O.S. |

### SELL Setup (Short)

1. Price breaks **below ORB low** (swing low forms outside ORB range)
2. Price retraces back up to at least ORB midpoint (A+ condition)
3. Find most recent **black → blue** candle pair (anywhere in lookback)
4. Structure level = `min(low of black candle, low of blue candle)` — wick low of either
5. **B.O.S. trigger**: candle **body closes below** that structure level
6. **Invalidation**: any candle body closes **above ORB high** → setup void

### BUY Setup (Long)

1. Price breaks **above ORB high** (swing high forms outside ORB range)
2. Price retraces back down to at least ORB midpoint (A+ condition)
3. Find most recent **blue → black** candle pair (anywhere in lookback)
4. Structure level = `max(high of blue candle, high of black candle)` — wick high of either
5. **B.O.S. trigger**: candle **body closes above** that structure level
6. **Invalidation**: any candle body closes **below ORB low** → setup void

## 3. Entry / Stop / Target

- **Entry**: close of B.O.S. candle (`process_orders_on_close = true`)
  - Short entry = body low of B.O.S. candle (= close of bearish candle)
  - Long entry = body high of B.O.S. candle (= close of bullish candle)
- **Stop loss**:
  - Short: body high of B.O.S. candle
  - Long: body low of B.O.S. candle
- **Risk (R)**: |body high − body low| of B.O.S. candle
- **Trade management**:
  - At **1R**: move SL to breakeven (entry price)
  - At **2R**: full exit (all-in / all-out)

## 8. Implementation Notes

- `process_orders_on_close = true` — entry fills at B.O.S. candle close to preserve 1:2 R:R
- Swing pair scan: look back 100 bars (i=1 to 100) for most recent pair — skip current bar (i=0)
- Black = bearish (close < open), Blue = bullish (close > open)
- Entry = close, SL = open (works for both short and long B.O.S. candles)
- Risk = |close − open| of B.O.S. candle
- Session reset at 18:00 ET (futures new session)
- MGC detected via `str.contains(syminfo.ticker, "MGC")`
- `request.security()` calls at top level (not inside if blocks) to avoid Pine Script warnings
- All setup state managed with `var` variables reset on new_session

## 9. Pine Script v6 Migration Notes

Script is written in **Pine Script v6** (`//@version=6`). Key v5→v6 differences hit during implementation:

### Breaking Changes

| Issue | v5 | v6 Fix |
|-------|----|--------|
| `strategy()` commission/slippage | `commission_value=i_commission` worked | Requires `const float/int` — inputs not allowed. Remove from `strategy()`. Set via TradingView **Strategy Settings → Properties** tab instead. |
| Multi-line boolean with `and` | `and` at start of continuation line worked | `and` at start OR end of line both fail (CE10013/CE10156). Use **intermediate bool variables** — one expression per line. |
| `math.avg()` | `math.avg(high, low)` | Removed. Use `(high + low) / 2`. |
| `barmerge.lookahead_on` | Used in `request.security()` | Deprecated. Use `barmerge.lookahead_off`. Safe here because `[1]` indexing already reads confirmed prior-bar data. |
| Local variable types | `gap_pct = ...` inside `if` block | Must be explicit: `float gap_pct = ...` |
| Loop variable types | `c_bull = close[i] > open[i]` inside `for` | Must be explicit: `bool c_bull = close[i] > open[i]` |
| Local risk variable | `_r = t_sl - t_entry` inside `if` | Must be explicit: `float _r = t_sl - t_entry` |

### Commission / Slippage Workflow
Since `strategy()` requires compile-time constants, users set these in TradingView UI:
1. Add strategy to chart
2. Click ⚙️ gear icon on the strategy name
3. Go to **Properties** tab
4. Set **Commission** ($ per contract) and **Slippage** (ticks)

The `i_commission` and `i_slippage` inputs in the script are retained as reference labels only (tooltips explain this).
